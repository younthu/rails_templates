          sleep rand(5..55)/1000 # this is NECESSARY in scalable real-world code,
          # although the amount of sleep is something you can tune.
          # Note the random sleep before the retry. This is necessary because failed serializable transactions have a non-trivial cost, so if we don't sleep, multiple processes contending for the same resource can swamp the db. In a heavily concurrent app you may need to gradually increase the sleep with each retry. The random is VERY important to avoid harmonic deadlocks -- if all the processes sleep the same amount of time they can get into a rhythm with each other, where they all are sleeping and the system is idle and then they all try for the lock at the same time and the system deadlocks causing all but one to sleep again.
